As part of a digital transformation strategy, together with technology partner Middleware Inc. (USA), ABM Cloud launched [Zabiray.online](http://zabiray.online) service. This is a chat bot that helps to buy products in the store without spending time shopping and collecting goods.

  

Viber bot suggests to find the nearest store or select a store from the list. Then the bot offers to select necessary categories and products, give instructions to the store employee, and choose the delivery method: pickup from the store or delivery to the door. Client can pay for the order in the store by credit card or cash. A separate cashier desk is available in the store to hand over the order.

*“Every day I buy a small grocery set of fresh products: milk, bread, fruits, pastries. Returning home after work, I usually stand at the checkout for a long time to pay for a few goods. Zabiray.Online helps me not to waste time at the checkout. Leaving the office, I place an order in the bot, and upon reaching the house, I go into the store and quickly pick it up. It’s convenient”*, – says Alexander Smykovsky, one of the users of the service.
 

Trattoria Al Dente, Kopeyka and LotOk retail stores are connected to the service. Network retailers and small shops near the house until the end of lockdown period can connect their store to the delivery service for free. To do this, it’s enough to just submit an application on [Zabiray.online](https://zabiray.online/#rec180274493) website.

Viber-bot Zabiray.online is the first project developed by ABM Cloud based on Corezoid Process Engine technology. Corezoid allowed ABM Cloud to lay the foundation of its own “digital core." ABM Cloud business analysts can now quickly work with the messengers APIs, test business assumptions, and track statistics on dashboards in real time.

  
[ABM Cloud](https://abmcloud.com/) has been optimizing and automating supply chain management for over 8 years helping retail and supply chain market leaders improve processes and increase profits.
