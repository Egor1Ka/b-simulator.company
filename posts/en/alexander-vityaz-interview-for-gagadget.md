Founder Corezoid Inc. and Simulator.Company Alexander Vityaz spoke with [Gagadget.com](https://gagadget.com)

Sergii Mitiaiev, Editor-in-Chief Gagadget said about this interview: "This time, we started (in fact, it was the topic of the conversation) with chatbots and ended with the dismissal of javascripters in his company, who were replaced by ChatGPT, the future of AI, and... energy communism".
