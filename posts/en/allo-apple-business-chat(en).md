Dnipro, 8 april, 2020 — Allo announces that customers can now use [Apple Business Chat](https://www.apple.com/ios/business-chat/), a new way for users to communicate directly with Allo using the Messages app on Apple devices.

  

“We are thrilled to offer Apple Business Chat, which gives us a powerful and engaging direct connection with our customers,” said Constantin Avilov, Chief Digital Officer of Allo. “The majority of our customers use iOS and we want to exceed their expectations when they experience Allo. Apple Business Chat makes communicating with Allo as easy as messaging a friend, so we expect it will quickly be adopted and preferred by our customers.”
