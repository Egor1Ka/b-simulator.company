9 September 2020, Kyiv. – ALLO became the first retailer in Ukraine to launch support for Google’s Business Messages on the Corezoid [Bot Platform](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/bot-platform-20). The new solution allows users to start chatting with ALLO directly from Google Maps.

 
For users, this means the ability to contact a specific store via messaging, avoiding phone calls. For example, a person who is looking for a specific ALLO store in Google Maps will be able to immediately enter the chat and ask the support service questions about store operating hours, status order, information about bonuses, availability of goods, etc.

 
In order to initiate the dialogue, the user needs to click on the “Messages” icon in Google Maps. Basic questions will be answered by a chatbot, which is constantly being improved using

Machine Learning tools. For more complex questions, a live operator will be connected.


“*In 2019, Corezoid was certified by Apple as the Messaging Service Provider for [Apple Business Chat](https://corezoid.com/bot-platform/apple-business-chat/). Now we are a [Messaging partner](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/partners) with Google’s Business Messages as well. Also, the Corezoid [Bot Platform](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/bot-platform-20) supports working with Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp for Business, Line, Sender and any other open API platform. Working with instant messengers is a good first step to build a “digital core” of a company based on Corezoid*”, – says Max Bondar, Global Partnerships Manager at Middleware.
