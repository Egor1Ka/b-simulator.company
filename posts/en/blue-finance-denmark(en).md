August 26, 2020 Copenhagen, Denmark. – Blue Finance (Finland) has announced the launch of a new platform for online lending in Denmark:  [https://kreditnu.dk/](https://kreditnu.dk/)

The service allows users to easily and quickly apply for an online loan and instantly receive a response from Blue Finance. A successful application is automatically processed, and the money is credited to the client’s account within a few minutes, sometimes seconds. The platform works fully automatically 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Denmark is the second country to use Axon, the lean banking framework built on top of Mambu Cloud Banking Platform and developed by Blue Finance. The company launched the online-lending service together with a technology partner, Middleware Inc. (USA). Mambu’s composable banking platform is used as a base of the technical architecture. The business logic layer runs on [Corezoid Process Engine](https://corezoid.com), which powers [Mambu Process Orchestrator](https://www.mambu.com/mpo).

“We are growing fast across Europe and have recognized the need to move to a more robust, flexible and scalable architecture, – says Hannu Kaila, Group CIO and Director of Business Development, Blue Finance. – The decision to move away from our old legacy IT systems was difficult, but we understood that in order to develop Blue Finance as a modern digital company, we had to become more effective in many ways, including technologically. The new infrastructure allows us to launch work in new markets within a few months.”

“It is amazing how little effort is required to configure and maintain Banking Products within the Mambu Cloud Banking Platform and build API-driven processes in a low-code  / no-code Process Orchestrator, powered by Corezoid. It took us only 3 months to issue [the first online loan in Spain](https://corezoid.com/blog/blue-finance-julio-gomez-corezoid/) in spring 2020. Now, two months later we are announcing the launch of the new platform in Denmark. Blue Finance plans to continue cooperation with Middleware Inc. as a technology partner across the EU markets,” said Kaila.

Ben Goldin, CTO/CPO of Mambu said: “We have watched the exponential growth of the online lending market over recent years and are seeing more new lenders enter the space. What sets new players like Blue Finance apart is their customer centric approach. They wanted to increase market speed so they can quickly respond to changing customer needs and market changes, which our platform helps to provide. The powerful combination of Mambu's composable banking platform and the Mambu Process Orchestrator helps position Blue Finance to continue to provide the highest level of  customer service, quickly and flexibly."
