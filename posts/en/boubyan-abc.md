Kuwait, 16 June, 2021 – Boubyan bank announced that it has become available to customers via Apple Business Chat. Apple Business Chat is a new way for people to communicate with businesses using the Messages app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch.

*“Apple Business Chat is a powerful and attractive channel of direct communication with our clients*, – says Abdullah Al Najran Al Tuwaijri, CEO Private, Consumer & Digital Banking. *Many of our clients use iPhone. Apple Business Chat makes communication with Boubyan Bank as easy as exchange of messages with family and friends”*.

Customers of Boubyan bank can use Apple Business Chat to receive all financial and non-financial messages and transactions alerts anywhere in the world without the need for a SIM card, they just need to have an internet connection. Registered users will also be able to securely get information about the hold reasons, information about the next salary date within their organisation, information about Corona safety measures, brokerage service, the benefits of platinum account and payment service, the saving profit rates on premium accounts, the rules and limits of international transfers, how to open new account for kids – the conversation is handled by our digital assistant, Msa3ed. Customers can also check the currency exchange rates and locate the nearest branches. As a bonus, customers can send math queries (for example, 58*57) and get the reply: 3.306 (just in case someone needs).

Also customers can communicate with a bank representative in real time to ask a question. To launch Apple Business Chat, customers can click the "Apple” Messages" icon on the Boubyan bank website or  mobile app and a conversation with a Boubyan bank representative will instantly open in the Apple Messages app.
Apple Business Chat is available for users and businesses worldwide on all Apple devices (1.65 billion active devices).
Apple Business Chat is integrated with native iOS features, services, and Messages app. With Apple Business Chat, customers can seamlessly and securely use the familiar Apple Maps, Apple Pay, Calendar, Spotlight, and Wallet to deliver efficient customer service that feels personal and meaningful.
The project was implemented on the basis of Corezoid Hyperautomation Engine technology in cooperation with the US company Middleware. Corezoid has been registered with Apple as a Messages Service Provider (MSP) for registering businesses with Apple Business Chat.

*“In addition to Apple Business Chat, Corezoid Bot Platform supports working with Google Business Messages, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp for Business, Line, Sender and any other open API platform. Working with instant messengers is a good first step to build a “digital core” of a company based on Corezoid”*, – says Max Bondar, Chief Product Officer at Middleware.
