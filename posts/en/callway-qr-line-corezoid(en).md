April 21, 2020, Kyiv, Ukraine. – [Callway](https://callway.com.ua/) company has launched a simple and free service of electronic queue. Under the quarantine conditions, a business is obliged to limit the number of people who can simultaneously be on the premises. But how to manage client flow conveniently?

Callway created a [Telegram](https://t.me/Queue_bjhbjhjbjbjhjh_bot) bot with two types of users: administrators and clients. The business owner can create a unique QR code and put it at the entrance to the store. A cashier or a security guard can play the role of administrator. The visitor needs to scan the QR code at the entrance and get his number in the queue. As soon as the store employee finishes serving the previous customer, he clicks “invite the next client” button in the bot – and the customer who is waiting on the street receives an invitation to enter the store.

The store owner can receive at any time full statistics on the number of visits to the store, and customers can stop worrying about their place in the queue. They might as well get their place and go walk the dog.

Business owners can also improve the bot: add surveys on the quality of service, loyalty rules (bonus points, discounts, etc.), upsell and cross-sell mechanics, invitations to customers to come visit again.

The bot is based on the Corezoid Process Engine technology and is available for businesses in the basic configuration for free via the [Telegram link](https://t.me/Queue_bjhbjhjbjbjhjh_bot).
