| Previous scheme | Scheme via Corezoid
| :--- | :--- |
| 20% of all requests were processed by online chat | 80% of all requests are processed by online chat

**Mr. Pavel Chishko, a specialist on customer self-servicing:**

I am responsible for online chat (robot voice mail, SiteHeart) that services the Bank’s corporate customers. It is available via pb.ua. A half a year ago we started using Corezoid. I communicated with the two developers from the E-business Center, and they explained and demonstrated to me everything personally. I dare to say that I had no idea about programming at all. Now the robot runs entirely via Corezoid. No complaints!

Previously, everything worked like this. A customer sent a request to the robot. The robot compared it for a matching word and responded to the customer with pre-prepared phrases. This was all functionality of the robot before we launched Corezoid. Now, to send some response from the robot, we pass about 10 initial processes, for example, welcoming a customer in various ways depending on the time of day, address to his exact name and patronymic etc. Now, we do not send a standard set of phrases, the robot by itself now constructs his sentence in accordance with the data that it receives. Previously, we processed approximately 20% of user requests, the rest of issues the robot could not answer. After the transition to Corezoid scheme the robot responds to 80% of customer inquiries. So we unloaded the Bank’s Call Center.

Corezoid enabled us to anticipate customer questions automatically, depending on page from which he launches the online chat.

If a customer does not know how to do this or that action, the robot can, for example, determine the customer’s browser version and provide him with the explanation for the specific browser. Previously, this was impossible to do. We provided all versions of the browser, and prepared a response for them all. Now, the capabilities of our robots are virtually limitless and we can do anything. We do not ask too many questions, for example about the above mentioned browser version. Some customers do not know what is browser, the others do not know where to view its version. The robot determines this by itself.

After the Crimean events the National Bank issued the decree that prohibited a legal entity to spend more money daily than it had on its account in the morning. So, our customers ordered the desired balance for the next morning. It was really a mass demand. Our robot did not yet work via Corezoid and we accepted approximately 10,000 requests a day, they all were processed by 15 Call Center operators. Naturally, they could not cope and we decided to somehow automate this process so that operators would solve more complex problems. They applied to the E-business Center with this issue. We were shown Corezoid in gestures, later we had a couple of extra talks and 2 days after we launched this process. When we saw that there was a tool that saved our money and did not make customers wait, we decided that it was time for all processes to be transferred to Corezoid.

One needs just two days to learn to construct something via Corezoid. I inquire to IT developers quite rarely, I build the process logics by myself. When in these logics a certain API is to be built in, only then I apply to developers. If API is absolutely elementary, I often try to compile it by myself, using Google advice.

If all software systems will be put into Corezoid there will be no bureaucracy at all. Yesterday, for example, I wanted to connect to the Bank’s customer database, I applied for access and was connected. It took just 10 minutes. Previously, it would be a story with technical projects, a million approvals etc. Sometimes we were waiting for testing for a month or two,. Now you do not need to apply for anything from anyone, just do everything by yourself, it all depends just on you.
