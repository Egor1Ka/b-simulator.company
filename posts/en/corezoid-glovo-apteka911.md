October 7, Kyiv - Glovo express delivery service and the "Pharmacy 911" website have announced the beginning of a collaboration. The main integration aim is to present all available on "Pharmacy 911" website products in Glovo application using Corezoid Hyperautomation Engine technology from Middleware (USA).

Glovo continues to develop express delivery service from supermarkets, goods from stores and medicines from pharmacies in the city. Today, the service has launched a partnership with the "Pharmacy 911" website, which includes 1,120 items in its database and works in 215 cities of Ukraine.

"Pharmacy 911" service displays in Glovo app the entire list of products available in 26 cities of Ukraine: Bila Tserkva, Boryspil, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Chernivtsi, Dnipro, Brovary, Irpin, Bucha, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytsky, Kropyvnytskyi, Kryvyi Rih, Kyiv, Lutsk, Lviv, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhia and Zhytomyr.

To order medicines, the Glovo app user needs to click the bubble "Health and Beauty", select "Pharmacy 9-1-1" and the relevant section (for example, "Cold and flu", "Detoxifiers and sorbents", "Bathing and hygiene") or use the convenient name search.

The "Pharmacy 911" website integration with Glovo service has traditionally taken place using Corezoid cloud technology.

*“One of the important goals of Glovo service is to constantly improve the user experience with the application, in particular in providing up-to-date information on the availability of items to order. To achieve this goal, we have been actively cooperating with Middleware for several years, not only in Ukraine, but also in some other countries where the Glovo service is present. Corezoid technology helps us to optimize the integration of new partners into Glovo. For example, new store activation takes only up to 5 minutes”,* – said Dmytro Rasnovsky, General Manager of Glovo in Eastern and Central Europe.

Corezoid technology allows to download and update the full list of pharmacy products, prices in the customers' Glovo app without any additional personnel involvement. The speed of updating the items range depends on the number of connected locations and the presented item parameters. Also, the technology automatically updates data according to different product params in specific pharmacy every 6 minutes, and the whole assortment in all pharmacies connected to the service - every 30 minutes. This allows Glovo users to always see up-to-date information.

What does the connection of a new store to Glovo delivery service look like?

When connecting a new location to the Glovo platform using Corezoid, technical integration rules are discussed between the services. For example:

- rubrics information source, medicines names, prices, images, etc .;
- the schedule of synchronization of data in Glovo and "Pharmacy 911" systems (prices, goods availability, etc.).

*"We are very pleased to work with Glovo and "Pharmacy 911",* – said Olga Hudik, Middleware's CBDO. *– We will continue to make every effort to resolve the complex technological challenges that enable our partners to grow."*
