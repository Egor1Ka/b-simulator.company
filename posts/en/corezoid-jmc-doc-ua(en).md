“We made it easy to request the help of qualified doctors. We connect relevant doctors to consult patients in chat on all the topics, including COVID-19. Answers to any question can be obtained around the clock and for free, – comments Project coordinator Yulia Gusieva. I would also like to say many thanks to Dubilet family for the initiative and support of the project”.
