Chatbot allows to send a request to the Kyiv City Administration in one of the categories: utilities, transport, health, advertising, education, trade, sports, electronic services, social and pension security, veterinary medicine, construction and others. Citizens can attach a file or photo to each request to describe the problem in more detail.

Each application is assigned a unique number. As soon as Kyiv City Administration formulates a response to the application, the citizen receives relevant notification.

Middleware technologies â€“ Corezoid Process Engine and Sender Communication Engine allow to build chatbots for messengers, as well as set up live agent workplace for consultations via messengers: Viber, Telegram, Facebook, Apple Business Chat, Google Business Messages, widgets on websites and other channels that are convenient for citizens to use. Middleware solutions are used by the Government Contact Center, the Ministry of Digital Transformation (for the "Diia" contact center), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Tax Service of Ukraine, Ukrainian Railways and other state-owned companies.
