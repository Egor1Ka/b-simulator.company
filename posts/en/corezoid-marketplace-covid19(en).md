April 23, 2020, Dnipro, Ukraine, – Middleware Inc. (the USA) published on [Corezoid Marketplace](https://market.corezoid.com/products/340231ee-fcf9-06c9-8c8a-135c51639403) a free medical expert system for predicting the coronavirus. A bot in any messenger can be used as the interface for working with the expert system.

  
By default, Corezoid [bot platform](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/bot-platform-20) supports integration with Telegram, Viber, Facebook messenger, Apple Business Chat, Sender widget on the website. To start the bot, you need to create an account on Corezoid.com and choose one of the tariffs. The bot template itself and the medical expert system are available for free.
  

A person is invited to answer several questions, after which the expert system gives an answer if there is suspicion of a coronavirus. Testing takes 1-2 minutes. The test results are for the reference purposes only and can’t be considered a medical diagnosis. In order to establish a medical diagnosis and determine the treatment regimen, the service recommends contacting a doctor.

  
Specialists of the online medical hub [Doc.ua](http://doc.ua) helped to design the medical expert system. Using Corezoid technology, companies can modify the bot to suit their needs: add integrations with medicine and product delivery services, appointments with doctors, etc.

  
The medical expert system was created on Prolog language based on [Deepmemo Rules Engine.](http://deepmemo.ai)
