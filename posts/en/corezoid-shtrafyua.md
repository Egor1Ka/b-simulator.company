September 1, 2021. – Payment and information service for Ukrainian drivers Shtrafy.ua and Middleware company (USA) announced the beginning of cooperation. Using the Corezoid bot platform, Shtrafy.ua has developed a solution to notify users of new fines for traffic rules violations. In Shtrafy.ua mobile application, you can now enable the setting “send notifications about the new fines to Telegram messenger”.

“The next step will be to add other channels for notification about fines, for example, Facebook Messenger, Viber and others. This will allow our users to quickly and conveniently receive messages about fines, wherever they are. The risk of missing the fine will be reduced drastically,” – says Denis Dmitrov, CEO of Shtrafy.ua.

Payment and information service Shtrafy.ua helps to control the process of monitoring and paying fines for violation of traffic rules, and also provides a guarantee of their repayment.

According to research by the Shtrafy.ua team, about 70% of drivers who do not pay fines lose their protocols, lack time or simply forget about the fines. Also, sometimes the money for paying the fine for various reasons is not credited to the account of the state body, which the drivers find out about too late.

Shtrafy.ua is useful for the Ukrainian state, as it helps to increase the volume of payments to the budget. With the help of the service in 2020, fines were paid in the amount of more than UAH 52 million. The money for the payment of fines is credited to the official bank account of the main department of the State Treasury Service of Ukraine. Users receive an official receipt for payment of the fine.

Shtrafy.ua constantly creates innovative solutions, taking care of comfortable and quick debt repayment by drivers. Shtrafy.ua are active in the field of creating a culture of safe driving in the country. In July, the service announced a solution for business, which allows you to check and evaluate the safety culture of driving in the organization for free for two weeks by referring to the link <https://b2b.shtrafy.ua/>.

Shtrafy.ua service was created with the State and donor support of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine, USAID, UKAID, Eurasia Foundation, Eastern Europe Foundation. The app was released in early September 2016 as part of the 1991 Open Data Incubator. After the launch, the solution entered the top 10 free applications in the "Finance" section of the Ukrainian App Store.

The solution for notifications about fines in Telegram is based on Corezoid Process Engine technology developed by Middleware. Corezoid bot platform supports Apple Business Chat, Google Business Messages, Viber, Telegram, Facebook messenger, WhatsApp for Business, Sender and any other platforms with open APIs.
