Insurance Company [EKTA](https://ic-ekta.com/en/) today announced customers can now use Apple Business Chat, a new way for users to communicate directly with businesses using the Messages app on Apple devices.

«We are thrilled to offer Apple Business Chat, which gives us a powerful and engaging direct connection with our customers. The majority of our customers use iOS and we want to exceed their expectations when they experience EKTA. Apple Business Chat makes communicating with EKTA as easy as messaging a friend, so we expect it will quickly be adopted and preferred by our customers», — said **Andrii Lototskyi**, CIO of EKTA.

[EKTA’s](https://ic-ekta.com/en/) customers can use Apple Business Chat to contact a live agent and buy insurance policies quickly and securely using Apple Pay. When purchasing a policy, EKTA’s customers can add it to Apple Wallet. With Business Chat, customers can always reach a live person and are always in control of whether they share any contact information with a business.

To start an Apple Business Chat conversation, customers can tap the Messages icon on the contact page on EKTA’s website. With iOS 13, when a user taps to call EKTA, iOS offers a suggestion to start a Business Chat instead. If they choose to message, a conversation with EKTA agents will open instantly in the Messages app, and users can take their time responding when it’s convenient.

The project was implemented on the basis of Corezoid  Process Engine technology in cooperation with the US company Middleware, EKTA’s digital transformation partner. From EKTA’s side, the implementation was handled by  IT-Director Andrii Lototskyi  and his deputy  Sergiy Bros.

Apple Business Chat is available in beta for users and businesses worldwide, and is built into iOS 11.3 or later. The new chat suggestions feature is available starting with iOS 13. For more information visit  [website](http://apple.com/ios/business-chat).
