29 September 2020, Kyiv. – EKTA insurance company became one of the first insurance companies in Ukraine to launch support for Google’s Business Messages on the Corezoid [Bot Platform](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/bot-platform-20).

Now we [offer](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/partners) Google’s Business Messages as well. Also, the Corezoid [Bot Platform](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/bot-platform-20) supports working with Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp for Business, Line, Sender and any other open API platform. Working with instant messengers is a good first step to build a “digital core” of a company based on Corezoid*”, – says Max Bondar, Global Partnerships Manager at Middleware.
 

«*We are thrilled to offer Google’s Business Messages service to our customers. It is a powerful and engaging direct connection with our customers. A lot of our customers use Google Maps and we want to exceed their expectations when they experience EKTA. Google’s Business Messages makes communicating with EKTA as easy as messaging a friend, so we expect it will quickly become a feature our customers love*», — said Andrii Lototskyi, CIO of EKTA.

  
The project was implemented on the basis of Corezoid Process Engine technology in cooperation with the US company Middleware, EKTA’s digital transformation partner. From EKTA’s side, the implementation was handled by IT-Director Andrii Lototskyi and his deputy Oleg Popkov.
