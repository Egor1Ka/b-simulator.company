The Help-bot by Epicentr K is a personal assistant that works in convenient messengers (Viber, Telegram). As the developers explain, with the bot’s help, an Epicentr K chain customer will be able to manage their online orders, search for a product or check its price, view the purchase history, get high-quality customer support on any issue, and much more.

Before launching the bot, the company decided to test it together with regular customers at its outlets. For a day, the chain sales consultants have been working with visitors and collecting reactions, and comments from them. All the feedback was taken into account in the final version of the service.

*"Our client will have the opportunity to open the support service chat using a messenger to get a quick answer and a solution to any issue. We aim to respond to customers within 1 minute. The service will also provide personalized valuable recommendations tailored to the customer's profile and needs"*, says Yuriy Kudlyk, Director of the Online Sales and Customer Service Department of the Epicentr K chain.

The [Help-bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vl9IA4jrHk) significantly expands services for offline customers of the chain, and, in addition to contacting the customer support service and receiving professional advice on goods and services from experts, a customer will be able to:

- contact an information desk of any Epicentr K shopping center;
- view the current schedule of shopping centers, find the nearest shopping centers, and build a route to a shopping center;
- scan an item in a sales hall using the chatbot without waiting for a free seller to find out the item price and specifications, view product reviews;
- find out the shopping centers, in which the product is available;
- get a Vygoda card or link an existing card to the chatbot in just 1 click, as well as use the card for code scanning at the checkout;
- receive a notification on the time an order will be completed and prepared for delivery;
- register in an electronic queue to receive an online order at an order picking center without waiting in line;
- extend the period of online order storage at an order picking center;

The **Support the Armed Forces of Ukraine** option was implemented in the chatbot, which allows you to donate your points from the Vygoda card to support the army. The donated points will be converted into cash by the Epicentr K company and transferred to help our defenders.

The proprietary Middleware Corezoid Actors Engine technology was used to create the Epicentr help bot. The chatbot was developed using the [Corezoid](https://corezoid.com/about/) cloud operating system. The Corezoid platform made it possible to combine complex processes of the Epicentr's internal IT systems and transform them into convenient digital services for a customer. For the development of the Epicentr K Help-bot, more than 50 integrations with Epicentr internal IT systems were made.

*“Corezoid supports Apple Messages, Google Business Messages, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp for Business, Line, WeChat, Control.events, and any other platform with an open API. Working with messengers is a good first step on the way to building a "digital core" based on Corezoid"*, said Olga Hudik, Head of the Business Development Department at Corezoid Inc.
