Redwood-Tashkent, July 30, 2020 – Middleware Inc. (the USA) and FinExtra Group (Uzbekistan) announced the beginning of cooperation in Uzbekistan. FinExtra will use Middleware technologies - Corezoid Process Engine, [Deepmemo](http://deepmemo.ai) Rules Engine, [Sender](http://sender.mobi) Communication Engine, [Control.Events](http://control.events) to work on digital transformation projects in Uzbekistan.

  
Corezoid provides a Platform-as-a-Service cloud operating system that enables companies to build agile API-driven business processes based on complex real-time event processing leveraging low code visual studio.
  
  
Corezoid technology accelerates time-to-market for new products and makes it easier to introduce changes to the existing services. Using Corezoid, business analysts can connect any APIs, build business processes, run prototypes and continually improve MVPs based on customer feedback. Corezoid allows companies to create their own “digital core” and solve the problem of integrating siloed legacy software into a coherent agile digital ecosystem. Corezoid also reduces the cost of maintaining an existing IT and accelerates the speed of conquering the new markets.
