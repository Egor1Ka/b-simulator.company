**METRO continues to simplify the process of issuing cards and interacting with customers through digital communication channels. Following a mobile application, the Company launched a chatbot on Viber platform.**

The chat bot is designed to enhance customer experience, enabling customers to always have at hand all most important and necessary things to make profitable purchases, right in the messenger.

The Company has already launched a new version of the mobile application this year, while preparing for the launch of Viber chat bot at the same time. “We strive to offer our customers a choice of convenient channels of communication with the Company. Viber application has already been installed by millions of mobile users, so availability of METRO card and individual offers in their favorite messenger will be most relevant for them”, said Alexander Fedosov, Marketing Director at METRO.

Bot in Viber will enable digitization of valid customer card or otherwise issue a new one, it will help customers find out about all available promotions, discounts and individual offers, and get access to a convenient interactive product catalogue. In addition, users will be able to create a shopping list, get directions to the nearest METRO shopping center, get the product price by scanning its bar code, request a manager’s consultation, and invite friends to use the bot. The Company plans to actively develop this channel in the future by adding new desired features to it, such as ordering goods, automatic formation of a shopping basket based on customer’s preferences, and more.

Thanks to the new tool, the clients of METRO chain receive new opportunities for interacting with the Company, have quick access to all necessary information and resolve any questions. Thus, shopping at METRO becomes more convenient and enjoyable.

**The project was developed together with Middleware, a METRO technology partner, based on Corezoid Process Engine technology.**
