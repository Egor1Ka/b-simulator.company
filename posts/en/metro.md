Kyiv, 25 April, 2018 – following the strategic plan of digital transformation, METRO Cash & Carry Ukraine together with its technology partner Middleware company (USA), continues to offer its customers the best digital services. Shortly after the launch of a new version of the mobile app, METRO presented an opportunity to receive digital customer cards in Viber app.

From now on any potential METRO client can easily receive digital card in 1 click and for free in Viber public account. A new user needs to send his (or her) phone number – and METRO`s Viber-bot will issue a fully capable digital METRO customer card instantly. Such a card can be immediately used in METRO at the checkout, without necessity to undergo any additional procedures. All cashier desks in METRO stores are already equipped with the special scanners able to accept digital cards from customers’ smartphones.   

METRO Cash & Carry Ukraine became the first retailer in Ukraine, that started registering clients in messengers. Viber is the most popular messenger in Ukraine with around 20 mln registered users. All these people from now on can easily receive METRO digital card without having to apply for the plastic card in the store.

METRO also set up a perfect personalised communication channel, since Viber allows not only to issue digital cards, but also to send reminders, instant notifications about discounts, promotions etc. METRO leverages Corezoid Process Engine and Deepmemo Rules Engine by Middleware to power cards issuance and communication with clients in Viber.
