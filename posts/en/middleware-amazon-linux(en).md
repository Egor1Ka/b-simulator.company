21 April, Redwood City, Calif. – Middleware Inc. announced today that it has achieved the Amazon Linux 2 Ready designation, part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Service Ready Program. This designation recognizes that Middleware and its proprietary technology [Corezoid Process Engine](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B013AYOIYG/ref=srh_res_product_image?ie=UTF8&sr=0-2&qid=1438670590321)  has been validated to run on and support Amazon Linux 2.

  

Achieving the Amazon Linux 2 Ready designation differentiates Middleware as an AWS Partner Network (APN) member with a generally available product that runs on Amazon Linux 2 and is fully supported for AWS customers. AWS Service Ready Partners have demonstrated success building products integrated with AWS services, helping AWS customers evaluate and use their technology productively, at scale and varying levels of complexity.
  

To support the seamless integration and deployment of Middleware Inc. solutions, AWS established the [AWS Service Ready Program](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/service-ready/) to help customers identify products integrated with AWS services and spend less time evaluating new tools, and more time scaling their use of products that are integrated or run on select AWS services.
