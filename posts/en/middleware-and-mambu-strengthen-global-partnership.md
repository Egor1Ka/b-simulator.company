Redwood, January 14, 2019:  Mambu and Middleware today announced they have strengthened their strategic partnership, which began with the release of Mambu’s Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS), to provide unique banking in the cloud capabilities.

The iPaaS named Mambu Process Orchestrator (MPO) is based on Middleware’s Corezoid Process Engine and was launched in September 2018. Through the unique underlying technology, Mambu clients can easily connect multiple APIs together to build holistic business processes. This can be done without writing or deploying a single line of code and operated in a true cloud-native way.

Clients are able to assemble processes in a cloud visual editor and MPO allows them to easily plug-in any APIs, orchestrate processes logic, track real-time statistics on the dashboards.

Explaining the utility of the systems, Lasha Gurgenidze, Product Owner at Space Neobank (Georgia) said: “We used Mambu and Corezoid Process Engine to create a mobile only bank called [Space Bank](http://space.ge/) in just eight months. Corezoid Process Engine allowed us to quickly integrate Mambu with the other systems and services.”

Using Corezoid technology, Mambu is building banking and lending business process templates on top of the Process Orchestrator to support client onboarding, loan origination regulatory reporting and card and payments connectivity in collaboration with its marketplace of complimentary vendors.

“Banks are not IT companies. API is not a product. Process is a product. In order to build products around APIs, companies need to do a lot of hard-coding, – says Alexander Vityaz, Middleware Founder and CEO. – Corezoid allows clients to change how they see APIs to thinking in terms of assembling processes in the cloud. Partnership with Mambu is a part of Middleware’s global growth strategy. They work with clients in over 55 countries and companies in these countries are now able to start leveraging Corezoid technology for their business through Mambu’s services,” – he commented.

“Mambu’s decision to work with Middleware is based on the unique vision and patented technology they have to offer. Middleware’s technological innovations will help Mambu build unique banking-in-the-cloud capabilities, as well as significantly increase the adoption of our cloud-native banking engine. After the successful launch of MPO, we are looking at using other Middleware technology like the Messenger Bot Platform and DeepMemo Rules Engine to offer more innovative financial products as part of our offering,” – says Ben Goldin, CTO, Mambu.

Both Middleware and Mambu are Amazon AWS Advanced Technology Partners with Financial Services Competency. This means both companies have demonstrated industry expertise, readily implemented solutions that align with AWS architectural best practices, and have staff with AWS-certifications.
