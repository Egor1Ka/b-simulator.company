Redwood California, 7 October, 2019 — Middleware today announced its customers are now able to use Apple Business Chat, a new way for users to communicate directly with companies using the Messages app on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. 

“Apple Business Chat offers a powerful, engaging new way for businesses to connect with their customers where they are and when they want using the Messages app on Apple devices. Businesses that use Corezoid Process Engine can easily sign up to try Apple Business Chat beta,” says Middleware Founder & CEO, Alexander Vityaz.

[Monobank](https://www.monobank.ua/?lang=en), which serves 1.4 million customers, will be the first company to use Corezoid with Apple Business Chat.  

Middleware customers can use Apple Business Chat to contact a live agent to ask a question, schedule an appointment, and make purchases quickly and securely using Apple Pay. With Business Chat, customers can always reach a live person and are always in control of whether they share any contact information with a business.

To start an Apple Business Chat, customers can tap the Messages icon on a brand’s website or in their iOS app. A conversation with the brand’s agents will open instantly in the Messages app, and users can take their time responding when it’s convenient. 

Apple Business Chat is now available in beta for users and businesses worldwide, and is built into iOS 11.3 and higher. For more information visit: [apple.com/ios/business-chat](http://apple.com/ios/business-chat).
