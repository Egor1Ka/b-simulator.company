Redwood – Kyiv. July 20, 2020 - monobank, together with technology partner Middleware (USA), became one of the first banks in the world to integrate with Google’s Business Messages support for its clients. The new solution allows users to start chatting with the bank directly from Google services: Google Maps, Google Search.


For example, a person who is looking for a monobank card issuing station on Google Maps or Google Search will be able to immediately enter the chat and ask questions to the monobank support service. Last year, monobank launched user support through [Apple Business Chat](https://corezoid.com/blog/middleware-offers-apple-business-chat/). Google's Business Messages is available by default on all Android devices and all iOS devices that have Google Maps. Now, fans of Android will be able to communicate with the bank through their native messenger engine from Google as well.


To start chatting through Google’s Business Messages, you need to click on the “Message” icon in Google Maps or search results or select the appropriate setting in the mobile application. Chatting has its advantages: a self-service menu, asynchronous communication, storage of the history of interaction, integration with payments, etc.
  

“*In 2019, Corezoid was certified by Apple as the Communication Service Provider for [Apple Business Chat](https://corezoid.com/bot-platform/apple-business-chat/). Now we have become a [Messaging partner](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/partners) for Google’s Business Messages as well. Also, the Corezoid [bot platform](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/bot-platform-20) supports working with Viber, Telegram Facebook messenger, What’s app for business, Line, WeChat, Sender and any other open API platform. Working with instant messengers is a good first step to build a “digital core” based on Corezoid*”, – says Max Bondar, Global partnerships manager at Middleware.

  

monobank serves more than 2.4 million customers. According to the co-founder of monobank Oleg Gorokhovsky, in a course of the recent 2.5 years monobank reached [the second place](https://www.facebook.com/oleg.gorohovsky) in Ukraine in terms of cards turnover (land + internet).
