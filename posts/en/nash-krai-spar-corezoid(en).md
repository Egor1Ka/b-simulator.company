December 7, 2020 - Nash Krai and SPAR launched a new joint loyalty program DRUZI ("Friends"), which has a number of advantages and becomes even easier to use.

Now you can register through the DRUZI application, which is available on the Google Play Market, via the chatbot in Viber or by visiting the loyalty program website. All the functionality and benefits of the new loyalty program are available in both the chatbot and the application. It is also important to note that a plastic card is no longer required.

The loyalty program provides a personal account, where after the registration a client can track accumulated and spent bonuses, history of purchases and receive personal offers: coupons, discounts, etc.

To start working with a chatbot in Viber, Nash Krai and SPAR signed the cooperation agreement with a technology partner Middleware Inc. (USA) to use its technologies Corezoid Hyperautomation Engine, Deepmemo Rules Engine, Sender Communication Engine and Control.events.
 
Yuliya Dymarchuk, Customer experience Project manager of Nash Krai and SPAR networks: *"Thanks to the new technologies, we have an opportunity to quickly and independently set up and change business processes, experiment with new ideas and improve the customers’ service quality. We are getting closer to our clients, because now they can contact us in any convenient way. In addition, we have taken into account all our guests’ wishes: here is an easy way to check bonuses and control the spending. There’s also the purchases history and useful tips, created according to everyone's personal needs and preferences.*"
