## Information about the customer

**Company name:** VashPult

**Activity:** e-shop

**Domain:** wholesale and retail of remote controls

**Location:** Ukraine

“VashPult” is one of the leaders of the Ukrainian remote control market. The company has existed since 1998 as a wholesale and retail supplier of remotes. And since 2008 it operates as an online store. Despite the fact that the company is small, as for today, VashPult is the largest wholesale remote controls’ supplier in Ukraine.

## Background
VashPult called upon Evergreen at the moment when business tasks greatly exceeded the capability of the old website, created on the already outdated platform. Moreover, to maintain its functionality became difficult and time-consuming. The company needed a new, convenient both for business and clients website.

How everything worked before: for the maintenance and accounting of sales, VashPult used two independent systems, which were not directly integrated with each other - Microsoft Dynamics Nav (Navision) and retailCRM. Navision tracked orders from wholesalers, stored the wholesalers’ price categories and the percent discounts for each wholesaler and category. Orders from e-shop fell in retailCRM and maintained there. Nav was one and single base for the company. Managers manually had to transfer retail customers orders from retailCRM into Nav. Updating the stock balance in the site had to be done manually as well.

## The aim of the Project
The primary goal of the customer was to automate the sales business process, combine wholesale and retail trade into one online store, and integrate their two internal systems with a new website. At the same time, the design of the new site should be modern, understandable and user-friendly, so that the client can quickly find the remote control he needs.

## Evergreen Solution
We have created an entirely new, modern, convenient e-store that allows VashPult to accept orders from both wholesale and retail customers. Also, there is the price-lock function which reflects personalised prices to authorised users. We have integrated the new site and the two internal Navision and retailCRM systems mentioned above. From now on, they operate like a single mechanism.

**How everything works now:** if wholesale/retail buyer makes an order on the site through the cart, this process is depicted in the CMS; if a registered wholesaler place the order, then it automatically goes further to Navision, where wholesale customers manager processes the data. In case of the retailer’s order, it is transferred to retailCRM and proceeded by the manager. If the retail buyer chooses the delivery by Nova Poshta, then the data from the site is automatically filled in the retail form to send the order. After manager's confirmation, the order from retailCRM automatically falls into Navision. The Corezoid platform provides integration between the CMS, retailCRM and the ERP system Navision. So the final recordkeeping is maintained in the Navision system, and then, information about prices and availability of goods are pulled onto the site.

## Results
In addition to organisational processes improvement, VashPult got extra results. For the first three days after the launch of the new site, the client received 14 requests by the function of the remote control photo selection mechanism. The number of online payments for a few months has grown from 1-2% to 9-10% because people began to trust the site.

Wholesale partners were surprised by the decision to ask them to fill an online request, because of the habit of working on the phone-mode, but the youngest and most progressive part of wholesalers has already appreciated new opportunities.
