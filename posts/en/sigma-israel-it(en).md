As all governments face major challenges in regard to healthcare and the economy, coordinated efforts are required to overcome the negative impact of the pandemic and adapt to changing conditions. The Summit featured an impressive list of Ukrainian and Israeli public officials working in this direction: ministers of healthcare, ambassadors, and other officials of the two countries. They shared how both countries responded to COVID-19 and discussed further actions.

Digital transformation is one important tool discussed during the speeches at the event that is part of the anti-COVID strategies of Ukraine and Israel. Digitalization of government services makes them more efficient and enables the continuation of business and social activities during the conditions of the pandemic.

Mykhailo Fedorov, Deputy Prime-Minister, Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, said:

“*This pandemic is a huge tragedy for humanity. We cannot change it globally, but we can change ourselves. This is an opportunity for both the state and businesses to use this time for a digital leap and for development. The Ministry of Digital Transformation will utilize this opportunity*.”

Representatives of businesses that joined the event help to advance digitalization in the area of medical services. BioBeat, Binah.ai, Tyto Care, and others presented Israeli case studies and telemedicine technologies that are transforming the way of in that health care is provided right in front of our eyes.

In line with generating transformation ideas, businesses need to secure investment for their implementation. Roman Gold, Managing Partner at JSCapital, uncovered the results that the Israeli venture capital ecosystem demonstrated during the era of the coronavirus. According to Roman,  over the first six months of 2020, Israeli startups raised $5.25 billion in investments. This amount became the absolute record – last year fundraising for the same period equaled $4.6 billion.

Prominent startup movement figures - Jon Medved, Founder & CEO at OurCrowd, Yossi Vardi, Internet Entrepreneur, the Chairman at DLD, Eugene Kandel, CEO of the Start-Up Nation Central, Oleg Malenkov, Partner at TA Ventures, Moshe Medved, Managing Partner Medved & Co. – gave blitz interviews answering questions about reshaping the future of startups, VC, and the tech ecosystem after fighting the Pandemic in 2020.
