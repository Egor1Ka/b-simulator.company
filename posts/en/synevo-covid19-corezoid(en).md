May 5, 2020 Kyiv, Ukraine. – Middleware company developed and integrated online testing system for the Synevo laboratory, which can detect the symptoms of the COVID-19 coronavirus.

Testing is available in the [Telegram](http://t.me/SynevoLab_bot) and [Viber](https://tinyurl.com/synevoViberBot) channels of Synevo. All registered users can complete the test for free.

Online test was developed by Middleware based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization.
  
A person is invited to answer several questions, after which the expert system gives an answer if there is suspicion of a coronavirus. Testing takes 1-2 minutes. The test results are for the reference purposes only and can’t be considered a medical diagnosis. In order to establish a medical diagnosis and determine the treatment regimen, the service recommends contacting a doctor.

The medical expert system was created on Prolog language based on [Deepmemo Rules Engine.](http://deepmemo.ai/) Integration with messengers was accomplished with Corezoid Process Engine.
