12 January 2021, Kyiv. – In partnership with Visa and Middleware, Ukrzaliznytsia launched its first proprietary chatbot in Viber and Telegram with the functions of direct ticket sales, ordering food during the trip, displaying the railway schedule, returning ordered tickets, informing about arrival, lateness, track number of the train, etc. Payment for tickets may be done directly in the bot without a "redirect". To do this it is necessary to add a credit or debit card to the e-wallet and to use Viber Chatbot Payments.

The project was implemented with Visa and Ukrzaliznytsia's technology partner Middleware Inc. (the USA) - based on Corezoid Hyperautomation Engine technology. The project was developed from scratch in just 1 month. For the first time in the world Middleware company integrated Visa token service to enable payments in chat-bot in messenger. Using tokens makes the payments easier and more secure.  

The bot is operating in three languages ​​- Ukrainian, English and Russian - and it collects the feedback in addition to providing background information.

In the first bot release, it is possible to buy tickets for Intercity+ high-speed trains and to check their timetables. Book your next trip via the Viber chat bot [from here](https://vb.me/ukr_railway) or simply search for the “Укрзалізниця” chatbot in the search bar in your main chat screen on Viber.
