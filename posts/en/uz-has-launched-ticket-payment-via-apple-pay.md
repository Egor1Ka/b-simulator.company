Ticket purchasing using Apple Pay is now available in the official Ukrzaliznytsia chatbot in Apple Messages. After making a payment, you can add your ticket to your Apple Passkit wallet. Online chat with the support service is also available through Apple Messages. As of today, the Ukrzaliznytsia chatbot has more than 264,000 registered users.

*"It is important to us that passengers can pay for tickets in all possible convenient ways. That’s why we have enabled a one-click payment option through the Apple Pay system in Apple Messages which itself makes interaction with Ukrzaliznytsia as easy as chatting with friends or relatives, and is the most common for Apple users"*, noted Yevgeny Yentis, Deputy Head of the Ukrzaliznytsia Passenger Company for Business Development.

To launch Apple Messages, just click on the Messages icon on the Ukrzaliznytsia website. A dialog box for buying tickets with Apple Pay, or talking to a support operator, will open instantly.

Apple Messages is available to users and businesses on 1.65 billion Apple devices worldwide, and is integrated with the Messages app, as well as with native iOS features and services.

The project was implemented using the Corezoid Process Engine technology in cooperation with Ukrzaliznytsia's technological partner, Middleware Inc. (USA), and with the support of Visa, a payment partner. Corezoid is certified by Apple as a Messages Service Provider (MSP) for registering businesses on Apple Messages for Business.

*“In addition to Apple Messages, our Corezoid Communications Orchestrator supports Google Business Messages, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp for Business, Line, WeChat, Control.events, and any other platform with an open API. Working with messengers is a good first step on the way to building a "digital core" based on Corezoid"*, says Olga Hudik, Head of Business Development at Middleware.
