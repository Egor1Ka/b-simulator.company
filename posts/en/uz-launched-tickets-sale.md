Kyiv, December 15, 2021. Ukrainian Railways has launched its official chatbot for ticket sales and travel notifications in [Apple Messages for Business](https://register.apple.com/business-chat) and [Facebook Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/Ukrzaliznytsia) – in addition to the previously launched Viber and Telegram chatbots.

Facebook users can easily access the chatbot directly from the main Facebook page of “Ukrainian Railways”. To run Apple Messages for Business, you need to click the "Messages" icon on the “Ukrainian Railways” website using iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple Watch. A dialog box for buying tickets or communicating with a support operator will open instantly. To start talking with the operator, you need to click the relevant menu item.

“Ukrainian Railways” together with its partner Visa will give 10% cashback to the passengers for every ticket purchased in the chatbot. This promo-campaign starts on December 15, 2021 and will last until January 15, 2022. Passengers who buy railway tickets for long-distance trains and fast trains via the official Ukrainian Railways chatbot will be able to participate in this promo. An important rule: it is necessary to pay for the purchase with a Visa hryvnia card, having previously agreed to save its token in the chatbot. Cashback will be credited to the card from which the payment was made within 10 banking days.

*"There are very few state owned companies in Ukraine that officially support their customers in Apple Messages for Business, so today Ukrainian Railways  is taking a somewhat unexpected step becoming one of the pioneers in this direction,"* – says Oleksandr Pertsovsky, CEO of the Ukrainian Railways Passenger Company. *– Passengers will also be able to buy a ticket and lunchbox using Facebook Messenger. According to [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1032334/messenger-users-ukraine/), there are currently 15 million active Facebook Messenger users in Ukraine, so we are glad to offer chatbot functionality to these users as well.”*

Using Apple Messages for Business and Facebook Messenger, “Ukrainian Railways” passengers can now buy tickets for all long-distance trains and Intercity+ fast trains, return previously purchased tickets, view schedules and online tableau to check which platform the train arrives on.

Also “Ukrainian Railways” passengers can add purchased tickets to their Apple Passkit and Google Pay wallets.

The project was implemented based on Corezoid Process Engine technology together with Ukrainian Railways technology partner Middleware Inc. with the support of the payment partner – Visa.

*“Corezoid [bot platform](https://doc.corezoid.com/v2/docs/bot-platform-2-0) supports Apple Messages for Business, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Google Business Messages, WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, Sender and any other platforms with open APIs. Working with messengers is a good first step for building Corezoid-based “digital core,”* – said Olga Hudik, Chief Business Development Officer of Middleware.
