April 2, 2020 Kyiv, Ukraine. – [VARUS](http://varus.ua) retail chain has integrated a medical expert system for predicting coronavirus. The expert system was built by VARUS Technology partner – Middleware Inc. company (the USA) with the help of the specialists of the medical platform Doc.ua. The expert system is available to users of Apple devices (iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, iPad) anywhere in the world through the VARUS account in Apple Business Chat.


“We created a medical expert system and allowed customers to access it through Apple Business Chat, – said Victoria Fesko, a business analyst at Middleware. We ask users to answer several questions, and then the expert system gives an answer if there is suspicion for coronavirus infestation. The service is implemented using Prolog language based on the [Deepmemo Rules Engine](http://deepmemo.ai) platform. VARUS integration was accomplished with Corezoid Process Engine. ”

  
Last week VARUS [announced](https://corezoid.com/blog/middleware-glovo-varus-partnership/) the start of cooperation with the Glovo express delivery service.
