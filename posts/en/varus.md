Also VARUS started using bot to conduct quality surveys right after customer’s transaction in the shop. Alongside with purchase notification, customer gets the question, if he was satisfied with his shopping experience.

Clients are willingly evaluating the work of VARUS supermarket. 30% of the customers who received notification are replying with their feedback through the bot. VARUS is receiving 4000 feedbacks every day.
