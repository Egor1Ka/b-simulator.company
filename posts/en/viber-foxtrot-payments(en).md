Retail chain entered the "pool" of Ukrainian companies that have connected a new platform for paying for goods and services via Google Pay or another mobile wallet.

On November 19, Viber Messenger launched [Chatbot Payments](https://www.viber.com/en/blog/2020-11-23/pay-in-chatbots-backup-media-and-all-thats-new-on-viber/) or its users in Ukraine. [Foxtrot](https://www.foxtrot.com.ua/) was one of the first to connect to this option for payments for goods and services using its chatbot, thereby offering customers another up-to-date and useful solution.

This payment method is very practical for those who are used to making purchases in just a few clicks using a virtual wallet (Apple Pay/Google Pay) on a smartphone.

“*As a dynamic, fast-growing brand, we are very pleased to be among companies that have had the honor of being the first to provide customers with a modern payment service from Rakuten Viber. From now on, our customers will be able to pay for purchases easily and securely using Viber Chatbot Payments, receiving fast and high-quality service both in retail stores and when ordering online*," said Eugene Krechetovich, Foxtrot’s Head of CRM Service.

The company also added that this function is practical for sales assistants at a physical point of sale. The only condition is that the client should have an authorized FOXTROT chatbot on behalf of which the client will receive a message for payment. If the client does not have a chatbot, the seller will offer to scan the QR code to install it, and then make a payment. All confidential information related to payments is encrypted and inaccessible to other chatbots, Viber or third parties.

>“Thanks to the Corezoid Hyperautomation Engine, we were able to launch payments in Viber chatbot in just a few days", - Eugene Krechetovich, Head of CRM Foxtrot.


*“The project was developed in cooperation with Foxtrot technology partner – Middleware Inc. company (the USA). Middleware took into account all the requirements of Viber messenger as well as our needs and quickly implemented a full-fledged functionality for instant payments via Viber Chatbot. Except for the Viber Messenger, the solution will be used in many other processes in Foxtrot to improve customer experience,"* – said Eugene Krechetovich.

  
As reported previously, this service will only be available to users in Ukraine. Chatbot Payments are planned to be launched in other countries in 2021.
