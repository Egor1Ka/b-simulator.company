Manchester, England, October 20, 2020.

[Banking Works](https://vls.uk.com/) and Middleware Inc announce the start of a technology partnership.

Banking Works is a leading UK-based provider of consulting and technology services to European banks and lenders including Klarna, British Business Bank and Close Brothers.

Banking Works has selected Middleware's Corezoid Process Engine technology as a key component of their technology portfolio, primarily for process management, integration and real-time systems orchestration.

“*Increasingly, banks and lenders need to bring multiple systems to bear on the functional challenges the market and their customers demand. We needed a scalable cloud platform that would allow us to orchestrate a diverse range of software and processes. Corezoid impressed us with its proven flexibility and resilience*,” said Dom Rodwell, Product Director at Banking Works.
