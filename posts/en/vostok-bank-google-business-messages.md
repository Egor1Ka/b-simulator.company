Redwood – Kyiv. March 24, 2021 – Bank Vostok, together with technology partner Middleware (the USA) announced the launch of Google’s Business Messages support for its clients. The new solution allows users to start chatting with the bank directly from Google services: Google Maps, Google Search.

For example, a person who is looking for a Bank Vostok card issuing point on Google Maps or Google Search will be able to immediately enter the chat and ask questions to the Bank Vostok support service. Google's Business Messages is available by default on all Android devices and all iOS devices that have Google Maps. 

To start chatting through Google’s Business Messages, you need to click on the “Message” icon in Google Maps or search results or select the appropriate setting in the mobile application. Chatting has its advantages: a self-service menu, asynchronous communication, storage of the history of interaction, integration with payments, etc.

*“In 2019, Corezoid was certified by Apple as the Messaging Service Provider for [Apple Business Chat](https://corezoid.com/bot-platform/apple-business-chat/). Recently we’ve have become a [Messaging partner](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/partners) for Google’s Business Messages as well. Also, the Corezoid [Bot Platform](https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/bot-platform-20) supports working with Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp for Business, Line, WeChat, Sender and any other open API platform. Working with instant messengers is a good first step to build a “digital core” based on Corezoid”*, – says Max Bondar, Chief Product Officer at Middleware.

*“Google Business Messages is a new opportunity for our clients to communicate with the Bank effectively. We are deeply honored to be one of the fist banks in Ukraine to have integrated Google Business Messages support for our clients in cooperation with our tech-partner Middleware. Taking into account the preferences of our clients and strategy of the Bank, namely innovative technologies development, we are focused on digital channels and services, for round-the-clock support a client is able to choose any convenient communication channel, e.g. Viber, Telegram, and now Google. It is very important for us to provide convenient and easy-to-use communication channels, if a client communicates and operates through digital channels”*, – says Iryna Kaspich, Bank Vostok Chief Technology Officer.
